      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>HRIS is committed to protecting the privacy of our users. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and how we protect it.</p>
      <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
      <p>We collect two types of information from users: personal information and non-personal information.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>**Personal Information:** This includes information that can be used to identify an individual, such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. We collect personal information when you create an account, contact us, or use certain features of our Service.</li>
        <li>**Non-Personal Information:** This includes information that cannot be used to identify an individual, such as browser type, operating system, IP address, and usage data (e.g., pages visited, features used). We collect non-personal information automatically when you use our Service.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
      <p>We use the information we collect to provide, operate, and maintain our Service; to improve our Service; to personalize your experience; to send you promotional emails (with your consent); to respond to your inquiries and requests; and for other legitimate business purposes.</p>
      <h3>Data Security</h3>
      <p>We take reasonable steps to protect the information you provide us from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no internet transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.</p>
      <h3>Your Choices</h3>
      <p>You can choose to opt out of receiving promotional emails from us by following the unsubscribe instructions in those emails. You can also access and update your personal information by logging into your account.</p>
      <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
      <p>Our Service is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete that information.</p>
      <h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
